Hash table:
1) load words.csv into your script
2) create a hash table (don't use existing hash table functions, but you can use an existing algorithm for the hash)
3) place the contents of words.csv into the hash table
4) give a user the option to fill in a word and tell the user whether that word is in words.csv or not by looking it up in your hash table
